# üéØ SITE CONFIGURATION - STRICTLY FOLLOW THESE

## MANDATORY WEBSITE CONFIGURATION:
- Website Name: ${name}
- Website Type: ${type}
- Website Theme: ${theme}
- Framework & Libraries: React.js (latest), Tailwind CSS (without config), Framer Motion
- Code Output: Single JSX file containing all pages, components, and logic
- Do NOT include Tailwind config file
- Ensure the file is fully working standalone, ready to render in the browser
- Pages to include inside the single file: Landing, Login, Register, Dashboard, Profile, Settings, 404/Error
- Functionalities to include: 
    - Form validation for Login/Register
    - Smooth page transitions using Framer Motion
    - Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
    - Use Tailwind CSS for styling Only (No other external libraries or dependencies)
    - Use SVG icons and illustrations more than text icons
    - Use React built-in hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef, etc.
    - Use Framer Motion for animations but optimize it for performance for each device.
    - Use Indian data in the Website like for example: Phone numbers (e.g., +91-9876543210), Addresses in India (e.g., Mumbai, Maharashtra, India), Currency: INR (‚Çπ), Timezone: IST (Asia/Kolkata) and names like trohan , ramesh , ayush , kartik , neha , riya , diya , harsh , rohan , siddharth , and more names like this.
- Components inside the file: Navbar, Footer, Sidebar, Buttons, Cards, Inputs, Modals
- Use placeholder images for hero sections, dashboard cards, and user avatars
- Include animations (fade-in, hover effects, sidebar collapse, charts/cards animation)
- Output format: A single JSX file with modular functions inside (but all in one file), fully working
- Avoid splitting logic across multiple files; all dependencies should be imported directly

## üö® CRITICAL ICON & UI IMPROVEMENTS

### üéØ ICON STRATEGY - NO REACT ICONS HALLUCINATION
**PROBLEM SOLVED**: React Icons library has inconsistent export names and causes hallucinations

**SOLUTION**: Use only these icon approaches:

1. **INLINE SVG ICONS** (Primary Choice):
\`\`\`jsx
// Navigation Menu Icon
<svg className="w-6 h-6" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16" />
</svg>

// User Profile Icon  
<svg className="w-6 h-6" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M16 7a4 4 0 11-8 0 4 4 0 018 0zM12 14a7 7 0 00-7 7h14a7 7 0 00-7-7z" />
</svg>

// Search Icon
<svg className="w-6 h-6" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M21 21l-6-6m2-5a7 7 0 11-14 0 7 7 0 0114 0z" />
</svg>

// Shopping Cart Icon
<svg className="w-6 h-6" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M3 3h2l.4 2M7 13h10l4-8H5.4M7 13L5.4 5M7 13l-2.293 2.293c-.63.63-.184 1.707.707 1.707H17m0 0a2 2 0 100 4 2 2 0 000-4zm-8 2a2 2 0 11-4 0 2 2 0 014 0z" />
</svg>
\`\`\`

2. **SIMPLE EMOJI ICONS** (Fallback):
- Navigation: üè† üì± ‚ÑπÔ∏è üìû
- Actions: ‚ö° üé® üöÄ üíæ üìä
- Status: ‚úÖ ‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ÑπÔ∏è
- E-commerce: üõí üí≥ üì¶ ‚≠ê
- Food: üçï üçî üç£ ‚òï

3. **CUSTOM SVG COMPONENTS**:
Create reusable SVG icon components within the same file

### üé® UI CLEANLINESS STANDARDS

**CLEAN UI REQUIREMENTS**:
- **Minimal white space**: Use consistent padding/margin (p-4, m-2, etc.)
- **Consistent typography**: Stick to Tailwind's text sizes (text-sm, text-lg, text-xl)
- **Clean color scheme**: Use ${theme} consistently with proper contrast
- **Organized layouts**: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox systematically
- **No visual clutter**: Remove unnecessary borders, shadows, decorations
- **Professional spacing**: Use Tailwind spacing scale (1=0.25rem, 2=0.5rem, etc.)

### üéØ COMPONENT STRUCTURE STANDARDS

**NAVBAR CLEAN PATTERN**:
\`\`\`jsx
const Navbar = () => (
  <nav className="shadow-sm border-b">
    <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center h-16">
        {/* Logo */}
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <span className="text-xl font-bold">${name}</span>
        </div>
        
        {/* Navigation */}
        <div className="hidden md:flex items-center space-x-8">
          <a href="#home">Home</a>
          <a href="#about">About</a>
        </div>
        
        {/* Mobile menu button */}
        <div className="md:hidden">
          <button className="p-2 rounded-md">
            <svg className="w-6 h-6" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
              <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M4 6h16M4 12h16M4 18h16" />
            </svg>
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </nav>
);
\`\`\`

- Use EXACTLY the website name provided: ${name}
- Build EXACTLY for the website type: ${type}
- Apply EXACTLY the color theme: ${theme}

- **CLEAN UI**: Prioritize simplicity and usability over complexity

## üéØ OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
