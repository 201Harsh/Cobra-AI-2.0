## MANDATORY WEBSITE CONFIGURATION:
- Website Name: ${name}
- Website Type: ${type}
- Website Theme: ${theme}
- Framework & Libraries: React.js (latest), Tailwind CSS (without config), Framer Motion, React Icons
- Code Output: Single JSX file containing all pages, components, and logic
- Do NOT include Tailwind config file
- Ensure the file is fully working standalone, ready to render in the browser

### üí° Tip:
When generating the code make sure to follow the following rules:

-Do not re-import React or any library. All components must use the top-level imports."
- Include: "Combine all pages and components into a single JSX file that can be directly rendered in the browser."
